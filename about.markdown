#Ever met a true unicorn? </br> OUTRAGEOUS!
Hi! I'm Sylvia Rosenvold, and I'm a software developer who likes to defy the limitations of the trade by combining my interest for design, with my passion towards coding and problem-solving. 
If you have a great project idea, or would like to hear what a true unicorn can do for you, then shoot me a message through the array of contact choices.
