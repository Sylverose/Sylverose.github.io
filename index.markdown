# Hey there!

I appreciate you trying to get to know me. I invite you to check out projects based on your area of interest. Whether it's my [coding](/developmentwork.markdown) skills you wish to see, or you happen to be more into [design](/designwork.markdown), I hope that you will feel inspired and excited to have a chat with me.
